## Course description

<p>AI is revolutionizing software development—are you ready? In this course, join instructor Ronnie Sheer as he outlines how AI has transformed the world of software development, and shows you how to stay informed about future trends. Find out how generative AI, which got started in coding as autofill and chat conversations, has been rapidly expanding into more advanced and intricate practices integrated with development environments. Along the way, learn how retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) can help focus your code generation, and how to build complete lifecycles of development practice with AI tools.</p><p>This course is integrated with GitHub Codespaces, an instant cloud developer environment that offers all the functionality of your favorite IDE without the need for any local machine setup. With GitHub Codespaces, you can get hands-on practice from any machine, at any time—all while using a tool that you’ll likely encounter in the workplace.
